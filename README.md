# Valentica - proeject reflection

- I have used Svgs wherever I could, since SVGs load faster than any other image formats.

👆 This is where I stop working on this project before finishing it up.

## Why did I stop?

This project makes me smile at myself and my silly passion to develope and work on client-side applications. The project was originally stem from a Job post by a guy in LinkedIn. I immediately started working on it and left the guy a text. By the time he replied, I found out this was only for locals of his country. No remorse but makes me smile at my thrist for development. 😁
